# SensingOthers - Accompanying code to the publication *The Neuropeptide pth2 Dynamically Senses Others via Mechanosensation*

In this publication, we show that the neuropeptide *pth2* is upregulated by the presence of conspecifics in zebrafish (*D. rerio*) and that this differential expression is regulated by the perception of mechanical perturbations in the surrounding water imparted by other fish. 

This repository contains two files. One of them is a MATLAB script that we used to activate a piezo actuator with particular activation and pause periods aking to actual zebrafish locomotion features. The other one contains all \DeltaC$_{t}_$ values we obtained by qPCR and used for statistical analysis.

## Figure 4
We describe how mechanical stimulation can activate pth2 transcription. The accompanying code to activate a piezo mechanical stimulator is provided here. 

## Statistical Analysis
All values are provided in the supplementary table S2. Here, we additionally provide all analysis code.
