# SensingOthers - Accompanying code to the publication *The Neuropeptide pth2 Dynamically Senses Others via Mechanosensation*

In this publication, we show that the neuropeptide *pth2* is upregulated by the presence of conspecifics in zebrafish (*D. rerio*) and that this differential expression is regulated by the perception of mechanical perturbations in the surrounding water imparted by other fish. 

This repository contains two files. One of them is a MATLAB script that we used to activate a piezo actuator with particular activation and pause periods aking to actual zebrafish locomotion features. The other one contains all delta Ct values we obtained by qPCR and used for statistical analysis.

## MATLAB Script for mechanical stimulation via a piezo actuator (as described in figure 4)
We describe how mechanical stimulation can activate pth2 transcription. The accompanying code to activate a piezo mechanical stimulator is provided here. 

## iPython Notebook for the statistical analysis of qPCR data
All values are provided in the supplementary table S2 in the accompanying publication. Here, we additionally provide all analysis code.
